/**
 * Output-token cap, negotiated rather than guessed.
 *
 * OpenAI's newer models (GPT-5 family, o-series) reject `max_tokens` outright:
 *
 *   400 Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model.
 *       Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead.
 *
 * Every other endpoint we support still wants `max_tokens` — OpenRouter, Ollama,
 * LM Studio, llama.cpp and the various OpenAI-compatible shims. So we cannot
 * simply switch, and we deliberately do NOT sniff the model name: the same model
 * takes different parameters depending on who is serving it (`openai/gpt-5.x` via
 * OpenRouter accepts `max_tokens` happily), and a name list would need editing
 * every time OpenAI ships a model.
 *
 * Instead: send `max_tokens`, and if the endpoint tells us it wants the other
 * spelling, send it again the other way and remember the answer for the rest of
 * the process. The probe costs one round-trip per model, only ever on the first
 * call, and it is a 400 — no tokens are billed for it. Endpoints that work today
 * see no change at all.
 *
 * Retrying is safe for streaming calls because the 400 arrives on the initial
 * request, before any chunk has been produced or forwarded to the caller.
